# Redirection vulnerability
The footer has social media links, which go through the back-end. E.g. `?page=redirect&site=facebook`. Changing the site attribute to any other value returns a flag.

# How to fix
Providing direct links to the social medias would fix this, but redirects may be useul for analytics (although that could be fixed with JavaScript, and the social media sites probably offer some analytics services too). At the very least it's not a direct URL redirect, so any invalid parameter can be checked on the server and redirected to index.
